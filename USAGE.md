# How to Use the Lenderhive Writing Style Guide

Follow these two simple steps to get the best results:

## Step 1: Ask the AI to Read the Style Guide

Copy and paste this text to the AI:

```
I need you to write content for Lenderhive that sounds like James Armitage.

Please read and fully incorporate EVERY DETAIL from this style guide:
https://github.com/Fluid-Technology/style-guides/blob/main/src/lenderhive_style_guide.md

You must:
1. Read the ENTIRE style guide from start to finish
2. Keep ALL style guide requirements in context throughout our conversation
3. Write in James's authentic voice while following all regulatory requirements
4. End EACH response with a self-assessment showing how well your writing aligns with EACH section of the guide

Once you've thoroughly processed the style guide, confirm by saying: "I've read the complete Lenderhive Style Guide and will write as James while following all requirements. I'll include a detailed self-assessment with each response. What would you like me to write?"
```

## Step 2: Make Your Request

Once the AI confirms it has read the style guide, tell it what you want:

```
Please write [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU NEED]
```

Examples:
- "Please write an email to potential customers explaining our Green Remortgage service."
- "Please write a LinkedIn post announcing our partnership with EcoHomes."

## What to Check

Make sure each AI response includes a self-assessment at the end. It should look like this:

```
STYLE GUIDE ALIGNMENT:
- LLM Persona Definition: ✅
- Voice and Style Fundamentals: ✅
- Language and Word Choice Guidelines: ✅
- Core Values in Action: ✅
- Product and Service Portfolio: ✅
- Audience-Specific Guidance: ✅
- Regulatory and Compliance Guidelines: ✅
```

If you don't see this assessment or notice ⚠️ or ❌ ratings, you can:

1. Ask the AI to redo the response with the assessment included
2. Ask it to improve specific sections marked with ⚠️ or ❌

## Important Note

Always have a qualified person review any financial content before publishing it.

## Troubleshooting

If the AI doesn't seem to follow the style guide properly:
1. Start a new chat
2. Try asking the AI to read the style guide again with clearer instructions
3. As a last resort, you can copy the full style guide text from the URL and paste it directly to the AI

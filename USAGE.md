# How to Use the Lenderhive Writing Style Guide

This guide works with any consumer AI chat application including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, chat.com, t3chat.com, and similar tools. Just follow these two simple steps:

## Step 1: Ask the AI to Read the Style Guide

Copy and paste this text to the AI:

```
I need you to write content for Lenderhive that sounds like James Armitage.

Please read and fully incorporate EVERY DETAIL from this style guide:
https://github.com/Fluid-Technology/style-guides/blob/main/src/lenderhive_style_guide.md

IMPORTANT: Do NOT summarise or compress the style guide content. Read and store the COMPLETE text in your context.

You must read the entire guide, maintain all requirements in context, write in James's authentic voice while following regulatory requirements, and end each response with a self-assessment.

After processing the guide, confirm you've read it completely, briefly summarise key elements of James's voice, acknowledge the regulatory requirements, and confirm you'll include the required self-assessment format.

Then ask what content I would like you to write.
```

## Step 2: Make Your Request

Once the AI confirms it has read the style guide, tell it what you want:

```
Please write [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU NEED]
```

Examples:
- "Please write an email to potential customers explaining our Green Remortgage service."
- "Please write a LinkedIn post announcing our partnership with EcoHomes."

## What to Check

Make sure each AI response includes a self-assessment at the end. It should look something like:

```
STYLE GUIDE ALIGNMENT:
- LLM Persona Definition ✅: Maintained James's direct, confident voice
- Voice and Style Fundamentals ⚠️: Could improve authentic language elements
```

If you don't see this assessment or notice ⚠️ or ❌ ratings, you can:

1. Ask the AI to redo the response with the assessment included
2. Ask it to improve specific sections marked with ⚠️ or ❌

## Important Note

Always have a qualified person review any financial content before publishing it.

## Troubleshooting

If the AI doesn't seem to follow the style guide properly:
1. Start a new chat
2. Try asking the AI to read the style guide again with clearer instructions
3. As a last resort, you can copy the full style guide text from the URL and paste it directly to the AI
